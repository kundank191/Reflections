How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier . I was only able to focus on the part that was changed .

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will definately save a lot og time. It will increase my efficiency.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually we need experience to something done , we can also control the amount of versions we
    create,
    But in case of google docs we have no control , But it is automatic so it can save time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It will be benefecial for multiple files which are are inter-related.it will be helpful if changing code in one part also
    requires to change other files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists all the commits.Using these commits we can get keys and then compare them using git log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can be confident to fix a bux more efficeiently in less amount of time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To efficientrly solve the projects that i have.
